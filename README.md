# warcraft3-hotkey-editor

A [hotkey editor for *Warcraft III*](https://jcfields.gitlab.io/warcraft3-hotkey-editor/) written in JavaScript. Includes all units and structures from standard multiplayer and the official campaigns. In addition to editing hotkeys, it also allows editing tooltip text with a simplified syntax and repositioning buttons by drag-and-drop.

## Limitations

- The icon order algorithm may not be exactly the same as the game in cases where there are button position conflicts (which, by default, includes several creeps).
- There are some special creeps and other units in the campaign that can potentially be player-controlled (through mind control abilities or otherwise) that may not be available in the editor, though their commands are typically present in the standard multiplayer creeps.
