# warcraft3-hotkey-editor

A [hotkey editor for *Warcraft III*](https://jcfields.gitlab.io/warcraft3-hotkey-editor/) written in JavaScript. Includes all units and structures from standard multiplayer and the official campaigns. In addition to editing hotkeys, it also allows editing tooltip text with a simplified syntax and repositioning buttons by drag-and-drop.

## Acknowledgments

Uses the [QWEASZ hotkey set by WTVR](https://www.reddit.com/r/WC3/comments/69p3nv/improved_custom_hotkeys_setup_by_wtvr/) as one of the sample hotkey sets.

[WTii's Unit Tester map](https://www.hiveworkshop.com/threads/wtiis-unit-tester.239333/) was very handy for testing.
